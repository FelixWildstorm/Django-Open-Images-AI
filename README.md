# Django Open Images App

This Django application utilizes the Open Images dataset provided by Google. Open Images Dataset is renowned as the Goliath among existing computer vision datasets. It comprises approximately 9 million images annotated with various metadata including image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, visual relationships, and localized narratives. Notably, it contains a staggering total of 16 million bounding boxes spanning across 600 object classes, annotated on 1.9 million images. Hence, it stands as the largest dataset available with object location annotations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/django-open-images-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd django-open-images-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the Django development Docker:

   docker-compose built
   docker-compose up
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Usage

This Django application provides various functionalities for interacting with the Open Images dataset:

- **View Images**: Browse through the extensive collection of images annotated with image-level labels and object bounding boxes.
- **Search**: Utilize the search functionality to discover images based on specific object classes or attributes.
- **Download Annotations**: Download the annotations for further analysis or integration into computer vision models.
- **Contribute**: Contribute to the dataset by uploading new images along with annotations.
